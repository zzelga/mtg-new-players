# Intro for new players of Magic: The Gathering

I've put this together to help introduce some coworkers to the game of Magic: The Gathering.

We will be using 40-card decks in two-color pairings, and playing online using the `Cockatrice` application.

## Download Cockatrice

This will be our "gaming" client application.

- Go to the website for [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/)
- Follow steps 1, 2 and 3 to download and install the `Cockatrice` (and `Oracle`) application.

## Connect to the Cockatrice server
- launch the `Cockatrice` application
- select *Cockatrice* > *Connect To Server* to log in
  - you will first need to *Register* an account if this is your first time
- use the `Rooster Ranges` server host unless told otherwise!

You should now see several additional menu tabs show up, including **Server**.
- click *Server* > double-click on `Magic - Welcome to Rooster Ranges`

You will now to able to create and join live game sessions with other players.
Now we need to load up some deck lists.

## 40-card deck lists

This is a collection of several decks that I sourced online from an old Reddit post.

[Blue/Black](https://scryfall.com/@whiskywizard/decks/8834b335-b849-412e-849b-3ebdb060785b?as=visual&with=usd)
[Black/Red](https://scryfall.com/@whiskywizard/decks/dd68e29e-80ce-4144-a11a-054f8e8e1035?as=visual&with=usd)
[Red/Green](https://scryfall.com/@whiskywizard/decks/488a979c-aa59-4cd7-92bf-9b3d0b5fd25d?as=visual&with=usd)
[Green/White](https://scryfall.com/@whiskywizard/decks/26369b2f-d1d5-47f6-abb2-9be1d185a2f2?as=visual&with=usd)
[White/Blue](https://scryfall.com/@whiskywizard/decks/cfff0079-2dd5-40d7-b06e-8e283dbe3d67?as=visual&with=usd)

For each of these, the link will take you to a decklist on [Scryfall.com](https://scryfall.com/) where you will be able to view what cards make up the deck.
Each of these has an associated `.cod` file in this repo that is ready for import into the `Cockatrice` application.

## Import a deck list

For any of the 5 decks linked above, find the associated `.cod` file in this repo and download the file.
ie. if you're interested in the [Blue/Black](https://scryfall.com/@whiskywizard/decks/8834b335-b849-412e-849b-3ebdb060785b?as=visual&with=usd) deck list, then download the file `blue-black-starter-deck.cod`

- load up `Cockatrice` if it's not already open
- select *Deck Editor* > *Load Deck* and select the appropriate file you've downloaded

## Create / Join a session

If you're the host, you will need to create a session - I like to set a password and only allow "buddies" so I don't end up playing with internet strangers.
If someone else is the host, you need to find their session in the list of rooms and just click to join.

You'll be prompted with an empty screen, where you will be able to *Load deck...* in the top-left side.
Pick out one of your deck lists, then click *Ready to start*.
Once all players are *Ready to start*, the game session will begin!
